/* A program that asks the user to enter their
birth month (integer 1 â€“ 12 inclusive). If the
user enters a value in range, the program echoes
the input ("Your birth month is: N") If the value
is not in the range it outputs an error msg ("You
entered an incorrect month value: N").  Here N should
be the value they entered.
